put the file at the bin dir of mongoDb, start a cmd and write mongod.exe. Then write in another cmd the following
mongoimport --db spaceships --collection spaceships --file spaceships.json

then write mongo.exe
common commands
- db shows - will show all the dbs you have
- use spaceships - will switch to spaceships db
- db.spaceships.find().pretty() - will show the db data
- db.spaceships.find({"Model": "Death Star"}) - will show the info for Death Star
